# rsa-style-cryptosystem
A simplified implementation of RSA written in python.

Running the script in a terminal defaults to `Interactive Mode`, which steps through the fundamental parts of the RSA algorithm.  You can find a more detailed description of RSA and the mathematics that makes it work in my [essay](https://www.schlamalama.com/cryptography) on the subject.
